\section{Implementation}
\label{sec.implementation}

Based on the new design we introduced in \S{4}, we implement a secure system, called Lind, as 
as test and verification for our new design and the our metric behind the design. We discuss 
implementation details of our system Lind in this section. 

\subsection{Two Basic Techniques: Google's Native Client and Repy Sandbox}
In the implementation of Lind, we leveraged two existing technologies, Google's Native Client, 
and Repy sandbox. We now give a brief introduction to those two technologies.

Google's Native Client (NaCl) is a sandbox for untrusted x86 native code \cite{NaCl:09}. 
NaCl aims to give applications the computational performance of native applications 
without compromising safety. NaCl uses software fault isolation 
and a secure runtime to direct system interaction and side effects through interfaces managed by NaCl. 
NaCl provides operating system portability for binary code 
while supporting performance-oriented features, 
such as thread support, instruction set extensions such as SSE, and use of compiler intrinsics and 
hand-coded assembler. We leverage NaCl execution environment. NaCl allows the efficient execution of legacy code 
in the form of x86 and ARM binaries that are built with a lightly modified compiler tool chain.

Repy is a restricted subset of Python \cite{Repy:10}, which is a sandbox that 
provides safe environment for running applications.

In Lind, we use Repy to safely re-implement a subset of the POSIX API, which provides 
fundamental operating system access to many applications. The POSIX API, which itself is difficult to secure, 
is constructed using the Seattle's Repy sandbox which provides performance isolation and safety. 

It should be noted that those two techniques, Google's Native Client and Repy Sandbox, are not required
our new secure design. It is possible to use other similar techniques to implement the prototype of Lind. 
In our current implementation, we adopted those two techniques because they are popular and reliable 
resources, that we believe are suitable for our needs. 

\subsection{Architecture of Lind}
The primary goal of Lind is to execute untrusted applications in a secure way. To achieve this goal, 
we try to minimize the portion of reachable kernel which might be exposed to applications in the user space. 
Existing system call interface in the kernel is rich and exploitable. We decided to safely re-implement most OS
functionalities in our Repy sandbox. We use Repy sandbox to reconstruct a POSIX interface, which provides 
OS functionalities sufficient for most applications. 
   
When security goal is achieved, we still want to execute applications efficiently, preferably in a light-weight 
way that can reduce potential overhead. We leverage Google's Native Client (NaCl) to achieve
this second goal of efficiency.  

Combining both NaCl and Repy sandbox, we have formed our dual-layer sandbox architecture 
design of Lind. (Shown in Figure 4.)

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Here we discuss some further implementation details about our system Lind. 
The discussion focuses mainly on the connection between the two techniques we used, 
Google's Native Client and Repy Sandbox. 

To provide native computation and safe access to the system, Lind combines NaCl and Repy. 
Untrusted programs are run in NaCl, but access to all system resources is diverted to our Repy program. 
This program is responsible for accessing the system on behalf of the program, it is called the Lind Library OS. 
Our NaCl sandbox is built on top of our Repy sandbox. To service a system call in NaCl, a server routine 
marshals its arguments into a text string, and sends the call and the arguments to Repy sandbox. 
The Library OS then executes the appropriate system call, marshals the result and returns it back to NaCl. 
The result is eventually returned as the appropriate native type to the calling program. 

Lind is designed to minimize its footprint within the trusted code base (TCB) of these two sandboxes. 
To achieve that, most of the Lind code is run from within the two sandboxes, the modifications to 
the sandboxes themselves (and therefore the TCB) was extremely small. 

The dual-layer sandbox mechanism completes the achievement of the isolation design goals through 
two features. First, the dual-layer sandbox ensures that all code can modify only device state, 
interact with devices, or interact with the outside world through the new trusted operating system interface. 
Secondly, the customizability of the interface ensures that the system can only modify state, interact with 
devices, or interact with the world at a rate and in a manner specified for the application. For example, 
any attempt to send spam or execute a denial of service attack would trigger limits on resource 
consumption and/or allowable addressing, and would be prevented. 

The dual-layer sandbox also makes the construction of Lind simpler. The complex part of Lind is the 
Library OS which runs in Repy. However, Python is a very powerful language, so it significantly simplified 
the construction of Lind. Even though Python is considered ``slow'' by some, the internals of 
an application in Lind are run in NaCl, a very high performance environment. 
This balances the performance of the system, with the ease of implementation and maintenance 
of the Library OS component of Lind. 

Furthermore, this particular design and architecture for sandboxing ensures the programs are portable. 
Programs running inside Lind are written to work against a standard POSIX glibc interface. 
The Lind runtime is strictly user-level and designed to work on many different platforms including Linux, 
Mac OS X and Windows.

Our sandbox also ensures performance isolation. It is used to limit resource consumption, 
both of computational resources (CPU, memory) and external resources (disk I/O and space, 
network bandwidth). The interposed system calls rate limit access and total consumption of 
each class of device on a configurable basis. CPU and memory limits are enforced on 
a per-process basis. 

Finally, this kind of sandboxing ensures that the lightweight goal is met. Overhead for the Lind system 
is low because the sandbox only incurs overhead when there is a system call; Lind uses a native interface 
for execution, allowing CPU-and-memory-intensive applications to run at speeds that are equivalent 
to NaCl and near native speed. 

Regarding our dual-layer sandbox architecture, one fundamental question is: are two sandboxes 
enough and necessary? Why do we only have two sandboxes? If sandboxing provides more security, 
why not sandbox Repy sandbox's TCB and get more security? The answer to that question is: 
the lowest level sandbox eventually must have some fundamental yet limited access to system resources, 
such as memory, storage, threads, etc. So having multiple sandboxes is not necessary, and two sandboxes in 
our design would be enough. But are two sandboxes indeed necessary? Why not just have one sandbox 
that solves everything? The answer is that the kernel interface is extremely rich and hard to protect. 
In order to have minimal tough into the kernel, as well as provide sufficient API for legacy applications, 
we need to have more than one sandbox to complete the job. One sandbox focuses on protecting 
the kernel and providing POSIX API, the other sandbox deals with executing applications efficiently. 
That is the reason for us to have at least two sandboxes.  

The key point in our design is to achieve safe re-implementation of OS functionalities. 
However, our safe re-implementation has limitations. There are a few functionalities that 
we currently cannot re-implement in our sandbox. Those functionalities include brk, mmap, and threads creation.

\subsection{Discussion: the Implication of Lind}
Lind inspires us to build more new designs with specific goals. It shows that new designs now have a clear and 
concrete guideline to follow or refer to, when leveraging our metric. 

Of course, whether our metric is effective in helping develop new system designs needs to be tested 
and substantiated. We leave that to the evaluation section (\S 6).
